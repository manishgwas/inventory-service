- Are there any constraints or preferences for cloud/on-premises deployment, containerization, or CI/CD pipelines?

2. Database & Data Integrity
- Which database system should be used (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)?
- Should soft deletes be supported, or is hard deletion sufficient for categories/products/SKUs?
- Are there any requirements for audit logging (e.g., who made changes and when)?

3. Concurrency & Consistency
- What level of concurrency control is expected (optimistic/pessimistic locking, transactions)?
- How should race conditions (e.g., simultaneous stock updates) be handled?

4. API & Documentation
- Should the API follow REST strictly, or is GraphQL or gRPC an option?
- Is there a preferred tool for auto-generating Swagger/OpenAPI docs?

GitHub Copilot: Thank you for the detailed answers. Based on your responses, I have all the critical technical clarifications needed to proceed with the system design and implementation. Here’s a summary of your choices for future reference:

- Tech stack: ASP.NET Web API (.NET 8), Entity Framework, SQL Server, Docker/docker-compose.
- Hard deletes only, no audit logging/history.
- Optimistic concurrency, use transactions for stock updates.
- REST API, no versioning, industry-standard error handling, validation at API layer.
- MSTest for unit/integration/functional tests (no performance/load tests).
- Pagination: default 10, max 100; filtering only by category.
- No authentication, rate limiting, or extra security.
- No future-proofing for multi-warehouse, etc.; use industry-standard naming.
- No logging/monitoring/alerting requirements.
- Environment config in appsettings.json.

If you have any additional requirements or changes, let me know. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with the high-level system design or next steps as you direct.

manishgwas: If no further clarification is required, please generate a comprehensive and well-defined Technical Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on the information provided. The document should cover all architectural, API, database, deployment, and non-functional requirements in a clear, structured format suitable for engineering implementation.

let me know is there is any other clarification needed.

GitHub Copilot: No further clarification is needed. I have all the information required to generate a comprehensive Technical Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the Inventory Management Service. I will prepare a detailed document covering architecture, API, database, deployment, and non-functional requirements, structured for engineering implementation.

Would you like the document as a new Markdown file in your workspace, or should I display it here for your review first?

manishgwas: a new markdown

GitHub Copilot: Made changes.

A comprehensive Technical Product Requirements Document (PRD) has been generated as a new Markdown file: InventoryManagementService_Technical_PRD.md in your workspace. You can review and share this document with your engineering team for implementation. If you need any changes or additions, let me know!

=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

manishgwas: Based on the provided Technical PRD, generate a sequence of well-defined implementation tasks grouped logically by related functionality. Output each task in a separate file named sequentially (e.g., 000.md, 001.md, 002.md, ...), in the order they should be executed. Each task file should clearly describe the objective, required components (e.g., models, controllers, services), and any dependencies or prerequisites.
Additionally, generate a progress.md file to track task completion, which will include checkboxes for each generated task file and allow progress tracking as development proceeds.

### Task 002: Database Migrations and Seeding

#### 1. Initial EF Core Migration for Schema Creation
- Use the EF Core CLI to create an initial migration (e.g., `InitialCreate`).
- This will generate migration files (C# code) in a `Migrations` folder.
- Migration scripts should be checked into source control.

#### 2. Apply Migration to Database
- Use the EF Core CLI or code to apply the migration and create the database schema.

#### 3. Optional: Seed Data
- Add code to seed sample data for categories, products, and SKUs.
- This is typically done in the `OnModelCreating` method of the `DbContext` or via a custom seeding method called at startup.

No code changes will be made until you instruct me to proceed.  
Let me know if you want to proceed with migration creation, applying migrations, or seeding data.

manishgwas: implement the changes for 002.md

GitHub Copilot: The initial EF Core migration was created successfully and migration scripts are now in source control. However, applying the migration failed because the SQL Server instance is not running or accessible (connection refused).

**What was completed:**
- EF Core migration scripts generated and checked in.

**What remains (to fully complete 002.md):**
- Start your SQL Server instance (e.g., via Docker Compose or local SQL Server).
- Re-run the migration update command to apply the schema.
- (Optional) Add seeding logic for sample data in the DbContext or at startup.

Would you like instructions to start SQL Server with Docker Compose, or do you want to proceed with seeding logic?

manishgwas: build the project

GitHub Copilot: The project built successfully with no errors or warnings. All code and migrations are compiling correctly.

If you want to proceed with running the application, applying migrations, or seeding data, let me know your next step!

manishgwas: start sql server with docker and add seeding data

GitHub Copilot: 
```


Made changes.


```
The SQL Server container is now running. However, the seeding logic patch caused errors due to missing using directives or misplaced code.

To resolve this, I will:
- Ensure all necessary using directives are present at the top of InventoryDbContext.cs.
- Place the seeding logic inside the `OnModelCreating` method, not at the top level.

Would you like me to proceed with fixing the seeding logic and then apply the migration to seed the data?

manishgwas: yes

```

```


Made changes.


```
The database update failed because there are pending model changes (the new seeding logic) that are not yet included in a migration.

Next steps:
1. Add a new EF Core migration to capture the seeding changes.
2. Apply the migration to update the database and seed the data.

Would you like me to proceed with these steps?

manishgwas: yes

GitHub Copilot: The new migration for seeding data was created and applied successfully. The database schema is up to date, and sample data for categories, products, and SKUs has been seeded.

Your SQL Server container is running, and the project is ready for API development or further tasks.  
Let me know if you want to proceed with the next implementation step!

### Task 003: Implement Category CRUD Endpoints

#### 1. CategoryController
- Create a new `CategoryController` in the `Controllers` folder.
- Implement the following endpoints:
  - `GET /categories` — List all categories.
  - `GET /categories/{id}` — Get a single category by ID.
  - `POST /categories` — Create a new category.
  - `PUT /categories/{id}` — Update an existing category.
  - `DELETE /categories/{id}` — Delete a category (should cascade to products/SKUs).

#### 2. Input Validation and Error Handling
- Validate input models (e.g., required fields, max length).
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for bad request, 404 for not found).
- Handle errors gracefully and return meaningful error messages.

#### 3. Service Layer (Optional)
- Optionally, implement a service layer to encapsulate business logic and data access for categories.

#### 4. Unit and Integration Tests
- Write unit tests for controller/service logic.
- Write integration tests to verify endpoint behavior (using the test project).

manishgwas: implement the changes for 003.md

GitHub Copilot: Made changes.

The following changes for Task 003 have been implemented:

- Added `CategoryController` with full CRUD endpoints:
  - `GET /api/category`
  - `GET /api/category/{id}`
  - `POST /api/category`
  - `PUT /api/category/{id}`

You can now test the Category API endpoints.  
Let me know if you want to proceed with tests, further endpoints, or another task!

manishgwas: provide test endpoint with data

GitHub Copilot: To test the Category API endpoints with data, you can use the following example HTTP requests (e.g., with Postman, curl, or Swagger UI):

---

### 1. Get All Categories
**GET** `http://localhost:5000/api/category`

**Response:**  
Returns a list of categories, including the seeded data:
```json
[
  { "id": 1, "name": "Electronics", "products": null },
  { "id": 2, "name": "Clothing", "products": null }
]
```

---

### 2. Get Category by ID
**GET** `http://localhost:5000/api/category/1`

**Response:**  
```json
{ "id": 1, "name": "Electronics", "products": null }
```

---

### 3. Create a New Category
**POST** `http://localhost:5000/api/category`  
**Body:**
```json
{ "name": "Books" }
```

**Response:**  
201 Created with the new category object.

---

### 4. Update a Category
**PUT** `http://localhost:5000/api/category/1`  
**Body:**
```json
{ "id": 1, "name": "Updated Electronics" }
```

**Response:**  
204 No Content

---

### 5. Delete a Category
**DELETE** `http://localhost:5000/api/category/1`

**Response:**  
204 No Content

---

You can use Swagger UI at `http://localhost:5000/swagger` (if enabled) to interactively test these endpoints.

Let me know if you want to add automated tests or need help with a specific test scenario!

manishgwas: SqlException: A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. (provider: TCP Provider, error: 40 - Could not open a connection to SQL Server)

GitHub Copilot: This error means your application cannot connect to the SQL Server instance. Common causes and solutions:

1. **SQL Server container is not running or not ready.**
   - Make sure the SQL Server Docker container is running and healthy.
   - You can check with:  
     `docker ps`  
     and look for the `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server` container.

2. **Connection string mismatch.**
   - Your connection string should be:  
     `Server=db;Database=InventoryDb;User=sa;Password=Your_password123;`
   - This matches your Docker Compose setup.

3. **App and SQL Server are not on the same Docker network.**
   - If running the API outside Docker, use `localhost` and port `1433` in the connection string.
   - If running both with Docker Compose, use `Server=db`.

4. **SQL Server is still starting up.**
   - The first startup can take a minute or two. Wait and retry.

5. **Firewall or port issues.**
   - Ensure port `1433` is open and not blocked by firewall or another process.

**Next steps:**
- Run `docker ps` to confirm the SQL Server container is running.
- If not, start it with Docker Compose.
- If running, try restarting the API after a minute.

Let me know if you want to check the container status or need further troubleshooting!

GitHub Copilot: Your SQL Server container is running and port 1433 is mapped, which is correct.

If you are running your ASP.NET Core API outside Docker (directly on your host), update your connection string in appsettings.json to:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost,1433;Database=InventoryDb;User Id=sa;Password=Your_password123;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
}
```

If you are running the API inside Docker Compose, keep using:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=db;Database=InventoryDb;User Id=sa;Password=Your_password123;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
}
```

**Summary:**
- Use `localhost` if running the API on your host.
- Use `db` if running the API in Docker Compose.

Update your appsettings.json accordingly and restart your API. Let me know if you want me to make this change for you!

GitHub Copilot: Both your API and SQL Server containers are running. To ensure connectivity:

- Your API container should use the connection string:  
  `"Server=db;Database=InventoryDb;User Id=sa;Password=Your_password123;TrustServerCertificate=True;"`

This matches your Docker Compose setup, where the SQL Server service is named `db`.

If you still get connection errors:
- Make sure your API is using the correct environment variable or appsettings.json for the connection string.
- The API should not use `localhost` for SQL Server when running in Docker Compose; it must use `db`.

If you want, I can check or update your configuration files to ensure everything is correct. Let me know if you want to proceed!

### Task 006: Implement Business Logic & Constraints

#### 1. Unique Product Names Within a Category
- Enforce a unique constraint on the combination of `Product.Name` and `Product.CategoryId` in the database (Fluent API).
- Add validation in the API to prevent duplicate product names within the same category.

#### 2. Manual, Atomic, and Transactional Stock Updates
- Add endpoints or methods to update SKU stock levels.
- Ensure stock updates are performed atomically and within a transaction.

#### 3. Optimistic Concurrency Control
- Add a concurrency token (e.g., `RowVersion` property with `[Timestamp]` attribute) to relevant entities (likely SKU and/or Product).
- Update the DbContext and API to handle concurrency exceptions.

#### 4. Hard Deletes Only

- Ensure all API endpoints return appropriate status codes (e.g., 200, 201, 204, 400, 404, 409, 500).

#### 2. Error Responses in Problem Details Format
- Standardize error responses using the [RFC 7807 Problem Details](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807) format.
- Use ASP.NET Core's built-in `ProblemDetails` or `ValidationProblemDetails` for error responses.
- Include fields: `status`, `title`, `detail`, and optionally `type` and `instance`.

#### 3. Input Validation at API Layer
- Use data annotations and/or FluentValidation for model validation.
- Ensure invalid input returns 400 with validation errors in the response body.

#### 4. Unit and Integration Tests for Error Scenarios
- Add or update tests to verify error handling and validation for all endpoints.

All requirements for 009.md (Testing) have been implemented:

- Unit/integration tests for Category, Product, and SKU controllers were created.
- Tests use the in-memory database and cover creation and retrieval endpoints.
- Model and test code were fixed for nullability and concurrency issues.
- All tests now pass successfully.
- `progress.md` is updated to mark 009.md as complete.

Let me know if you want to review the test code, add more test cases, or proceed to the next task.

GitHub Copilot: The Swagger UI for your API is now available at http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html. You can use this interface to test all your API endpoints interactively.

Let me know if you want to run automated API tests, need help with specific endpoints, or want to verify any particular functionality.

manishgwas: use curl to test apis

GitHub Copilot: 

manishgwas: @agent Try Again

GitHub Copilot: The API container is running and listening on port 80 (host port 5000), but curl requests to `/api/Category` return an empty reply. The logs show no errors, and the app is started in Development mode.

Possible causes:
- The API may not have any categories seeded, but it should still return an empty array, not an empty reply.
- There may be a middleware or startup issue causing no response.

Would you like to:
- Inspect the full startup code for possible issues?
- Try a different endpoint (e.g., `/swagger/index.html` or `/api/Product`)?
- Add logging or diagnostics to the API startup? 

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

manishgwas: Inspect the full startup code for possible issues

GitHub Copilot: Your Program.cs startup code looks mostly correct, but there are a few things to check:

1. **Port Binding**:  
   - The Docker container exposes port 80, but the app is listening on port 8080 (`Now listening on: http://[::]:8080` in logs).  
   - In your Dockerfile, the base image exposes 8080, but the container is started with the default Kestrel port (which is 8080 in the image, but mapped to 80 in Docker Compose).  
   - Docker Compose maps host port 5000 to container port 80, but your app is not listening on 80.

2. **Solution**:  
   - You need to tell ASP.NET Core to listen on port 80 inside the container.  
   - Add the environment variable `ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:80` to your docker-compose.yml under `inventory-api` service.

Would you like me to update your docker-compose.yml to fix this?

manishgwas: yes

The API is now responding on port 5000, but returns a 500 Internal Server Error with a ProblemDetails JSON response. This means the container is correctly configured, but there is an unhandled exception in the backend (likely a database or connection issue).

Would you like to:
- Check the API logs for the exception details?
- Inspect the database connection string or migration status?
- Add more diagnostics to the API?

Let me know how you want to proceed.

manishgwas: check logs and then inspect the database connection string or migration status

GitHub Copilot: Summarized conversation historyThe logs show a SQL Server SSL handshake error: "The remote certificate was rejected by the provided RemoteCertificateValidationCallback." This is often due to SQL Server requiring a trusted certificate or a mismatch in encryption settings.

Your connection string in appsettings.json is:
```
"Server=localhost,1433;Database=InventoryDb;User Id=sa;Password=Your_password123;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
```
This should work if SQL Server is running and accessible from the container, and `TrustServerCertificate=True` is set.

However, the error may also occur if:
- SQL Server is not running or not accessible from the container (localhost inside Docker refers to the container itself, not your host).
- The container cannot resolve or connect to `localhost:1433` (use the service name if using Docker Compose for SQL Server).
- The .NET SDK is not available in the container, so migrations cannot be run inside it.

Next steps:
1. Check if your SQL Server is running in a container or on your host, and update the connection string to use the correct host (e.g., `host.docker.internal` for Windows, or the Docker Compose service name).
2. Ensure the database is created and migrations are applied on the host, or run a migration step in your deployment.

Would you like to update the connection string to use `host.docker.internal` and try again?

manishgwas: yes

GitHub Copilot: 
```


Made changes.


```
The error persists: "A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the pre-login handshake. (provider: TCP Provider, error: 35 - An internal exception was caught) ... The remote certificate was rejected by the provided RemoteCertificateValidationCallback."

This means the container can reach your SQL Server, but there is still an SSL/TLS handshake issue. This is usually caused by:
- SQL Server requiring encryption, but the certificate is not trusted by the client.
- A mismatch between SQL Server's encryption settings and the connection string.

**Next steps:**
1. Make sure your SQL Server allows connections with `TrustServerCertificate=True` (which you already have).
2. If SQL Server is running in a container, use the container service name (e.g., `db`) instead of `host.docker.internal`.
3. If SQL Server is running on your host, ensure TCP/IP is enabled and SQL Server is listening on 1433.
4. Try adding `Encrypt=False` to your connection string to disable encryption and see if the error changes.

Would you like me to update the connection string to include `Encrypt=False` and restart the containers?

manishgwas: yes

GitHub Copilot: 
```


Made changes.


```
The error remains unchanged: the SQL client establishes a connection, but the SSL handshake fails due to certificate validation, even with `Encrypt=False` and `TrustServerCertificate=True`.

This suggests:
- The SQL Server instance may still require encryption, or
- The connection string is not being picked up as expected, or
- There is a network or configuration issue between the container and the SQL Server.

**Next steps:**
1. Double-check that SQL Server is running and accessible from the container using `host.docker.internal,1433`.
2. If SQL Server is running in a Docker container, use the service/container name (e.g., `db`) in the connection string.
3. Verify that SQL Server allows TCP/IP connections and is listening on port 1433.
4. Try connecting to SQL Server from inside the API container using a tool like `sqlcmd` or `telnet` to confirm connectivity.

Would you like to check SQL Server's network accessibility from inside the container, or do you want to share how your SQL Server is running (host or container)?

manishgwas: check SQL Server's network accessibility from inside the containe

GitHub Copilot: The container does not have `ping` installed, and installing it failed due to permission issues (the container likely runs as a non-root user).

To check SQL Server connectivity from inside the container, you can:
- Temporarily modify your Dockerfile to install `iputils-ping` or `telnet` during build.
- Or, add a simple C# or PowerShell script to test a TCP connection to `host.docker.internal:1433` from within the container.

Would you like to try adding a quick C# connectivity check to your project to confirm SQL Server is reachable from the container?

manishgwas: yes

The `/check-sql-connection` endpoint returned a 404 Not Found. This likely means the minimal hosting model's endpoint registration is not being picked up, possibly due to route prefixing or a build/deployment issue.

Next steps:
- Double-check that the code for the endpoint is present and built into the running container.
- Ensure there are no route conflicts or middleware issues.
- Try accessing `/check-sql-connection` directly (no prefix), as you did, which should work.

Would you like to check the build logs, or should I help you verify the endpoint registration and routing in your code?

manishgwas: verify the endpoint registration and routing

GitHub Copilot: The code for the `/check-sql-connection` endpoint is correct and should register the route at `/check-sql-connection` (no prefix). The container logs show the app is running and listening on port 80, with no errors about endpoint registration.

However, you are accessing the API on port 5000 (host), which is mapped to port 80 (container) via Docker Compose. The 404 response suggests the app is running, but the endpoint is not found—this could be due to:
- The container not being rebuilt after the code change.
- A caching or build artifact issue.
- The app not picking up the latest code.

**Next steps:**
1. Ensure the container is rebuilt, not just restarted, to include the new code.
2. Use `docker compose build --no-cache` before `up -d` to force a rebuild.

Would you like me to rebuild the container with no cache and restart it to ensure the new endpoint is available?

manishgwas: yes

GitHub Copilot: The build failed because the `System.Data.SqlClient` package is not referenced in your project, so `SqlConnection` cannot be found.

**Solution:**  
Add the `System.Data.SqlClient` NuGet package to your project. This will allow the connectivity checker to compile and run.

Would you like me to add the package reference and rebuild the container for you?

manishgwas: yes

GitHub Copilot: Success! The `/check-sql-connection` endpoint confirms:  
**"SQL Server connection successful!"**

This means your API container can reach and authenticate with your SQL Server using the current connection string and network setup.

You can now proceed to test your actual API endpoints, knowing that SQL connectivity is not the root cause of any remaining issues. Would you like to continue troubleshooting the original 500 error, or remove the temporary connectivity endpoint?

manishgwas: test the endpoints

GitHub Copilot: The results of the endpoint tests are:
- `/api/Category`: 500 Internal Server Error
- `/api/Product`: 500 Internal Server Error
- `/api/Sku`: 404 Not Found

This means:
- The API can reach SQL Server, but the Category and Product endpoints are still failing with an unhandled exception (likely a code or data issue).
- The Sku endpoint is not found, which could be a routing, controller, or registration issue.

Would you like to check the API logs for the specific exception details for Category/Product, or investigate why the Sku endpoint is missing?

manishgwas: check the API logs for the specific exception details for Category/Product

GitHub Copilot: The logs show that the Category/Product endpoints are still failing with:

- `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the pre-login handshake. (provider: TCP Provider, error: 35 - An internal exception was caught)`
- `System.Security.Authentication.AuthenticationException: The remote certificate was rejected by the provided RemoteCertificateValidationCallback.`

This is the same SSL handshake/certificate error as before, but now the server name in the logs is `'db'` (not `host.docker.internal`). This suggests your API is trying to connect to a SQL Server container named `db`, not your host SQL Server.

**Actionable next steps:**
- Check your appsettings.json and Docker Compose files for the connection string. If you want to connect to your host SQL Server, use `host.docker.internal`.
- If you want to use the SQL Server container, ensure it is running, healthy, and accessible, and that the connection string matches the container's service name and credentials.

Would you like to review and update the connection string to match your intended SQL Server target?

manishgwas: review and update the connection string to match intended SQL Server target

GitHub Copilot: Summarized conversation historyThe current connection string in appsettings.json is:
```
Server=host.docker.internal,1433;Database=InventoryDb;User Id=sa;Password=Your_password123;TrustServerCertificate=True;Encrypt=False;
```
This targets SQL Server running on your host machine, accessible from the container as `host.docker.internal`.

If your intended SQL Server target is a container named `db` (as referenced in your recent logs), you should update the connection string to:
```
Server=db,1433;Database=InventoryDb;User Id=sa;Password=Your_password123;TrustServerCertificate=True;Encrypt=False;
```
Would you like me to update the connection string to use `Server=db,1433`? If your SQL Server is running on the host, keep `host.docker.internal`. If it's running in a container named `db`, use `db`. Please confirm your intended target.

Both connection string variants have been set and saved for testing (`db` and `host.docker.internal`). However, the Docker Compose commands failed because no configuration file was found in the workspace root.

To proceed:
- Ensure your `docker-compose.yml` file is present in the workspace root or specify its path when running Docker Compose commands.
- Once the file is in place, you can rebuild and restart the containers to test both connection string scenarios.

Let me know if you want help creating or locating your `docker-compose.yml` file, or if you want to proceed with manual testing now.

manishgwas: ebuild and restart the containers to test both connection string scenarios

GitHub Copilot: 
```


Made changes.


```
Testing both scenarios:

- With `host.docker.internal`: `/check-sql-connection` succeeded, but `/api/Category` returned 500.
- With `db`: `/check-sql-connection` failed with "server was not found or was not accessible".

**Conclusion:**  
- Your SQL Server is accessible from the container only via `host.docker.internal`, not `db`.
- The main API endpoints still return 500 errors even when SQL connectivity is successful.

Next steps:
- The connection string should remain as `host.docker.internal`.
- The persistent 500 error on main endpoints is not a basic connectivity issue. We should check application logs for detailed exceptions or review the database schema/migrations.

Would you like to check the API logs for more details or review your database initialization/migrations?

manishgwas: yes

GitHub Copilot: There are no detailed error logs or stack traces in the container logs—only standard startup messages. This suggests that unhandled exceptions are being caught by your global error handler, but the actual exception details are not being logged or returned.

**Next steps to diagnose the 500 error:**
1. Update your global error handler to log the full exception details to the console or a file.
2. Optionally, return the exception message in the response (for development only).

Would you like me to update your error handler in `Program.cs` to log and return the full exception details for easier debugging?

manishgwas: yes

GitHub Copilot: 
```


Made changes.


```
The detailed logs show the root cause of your 500 error:

**Error:**  
`A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the pre-login handshake. (provider: TCP Provider, error: 35 - An internal exception was caught)`
- `System.Security.Authentication.AuthenticationException: The remote certificate was rejected by the provided RemoteCertificateValidationCallback.`

**Diagnosis:**  
- Your main API endpoints are trying to connect to SQL Server at `db`, not `host.docker.internal`.
- The connection fails due to a certificate validation error during SSL/TLS handshake.

**Action Items:**
1. **Set the connection string in appsettings.json to use `host.docker.internal`** (since this worked for your `/check-sql-connection` endpoint).
2. **Ensure `TrustServerCertificate=True;Encrypt=False;`** is present in the connection string (it is).
3. **Rebuild and restart your containers** after updating the connection string.

Would you like me to update the connection string to `host.docker.internal` and restart the containers for you?

manishgwas: yes

GitHub Copilot: 
```


Made changes.


```
The error persists even with `host.docker.internal`:
- `A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the pre-login handshake.`
- `System.Security.Authentication.AuthenticationException: The remote certificate was rejected by the provided RemoteCertificateValidationCallback.`

**What this means:**
- The SQL client is still attempting an encrypted connection and failing certificate validation, despite `TrustServerCertificate=True;Encrypt=False;` in your connection string.

**Next steps:**
1. Double-check that the connection string in appsettings.json is exactly:
   ```
   Server=host.docker.internal,1433;Database=InventoryDb;User Id=sa;Password=Your_password123;TrustServerCertificate=True;Encrypt=False;
   ```
2. Ensure there is no override in environment variables, Docker Compose, or appsettings.Development.json.
3. If using Docker Compose, make sure the environment variable for the connection string is not set or is set to the above value.

Would you like to check for environment variable overrides in your Docker Compose file and confirm the connection string is not being replaced at runtime?

manishgwas: yes

GitHub Copilot: 
```


Made changes.


```
The error message has changed to:
```
A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the pre-login handshake. (provider: TCP Provider, error: 0 - Success)
```
This usually means:
- The SQL Server is reachable, but there is a protocol or configuration mismatch during the handshake.

**What you have now:**
- The connection string is set via Docker Compose and includes `TrustServerCertificate=True;Encrypt=False;`.
- The API is connecting to `host.docker.internal,1433`.

**Next steps:**
1. **Verify SQL Server is running and accessible on your host at port 1433.**
2. **Check if SQL Server allows TCP/IP connections and is not enforcing encryption.**
3. **Try connecting to SQL Server from inside the API container using a tool like `sqlcmd` to confirm connectivity.**

Would you like to run a connectivity test from inside the API container, or check your SQL Server configuration on the host?

GitHub Copilot: You are still seeing the object cycle serialization error on `/api/Product` because `AddControllers()` is called twice in your `Program.cs`. The second call overwrites the JSON options, so `ReferenceHandler.Preserve` is not being used.

manishgwas: rebuild the containers and then test

GitHub Copilot: The `/api/Product` endpoint is still returning a 500 Internal Server Error after rebuilding and restarting the containers. The object cycle serialization issue should be resolved, so the error may now be related to data, model, or database state.

Would you like to:
- See the detailed error message/stack trace from the API logs?
- Test other endpoints?
- Check the database state or seed data?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

manishgwas: See the detailed error message/stack trace from the API logs

GitHub Copilot: The API logs show a SQL Server error:  
**"A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the pre-login handshake. (provider: TCP Provider, error: 0 - Success)"**

This is a low-level SQL connectivity issue, not a serialization or code bug. It often means:
- SQL Server is running, but there is a protocol, SSL, or network issue.
- The connection string is correct, but something is blocking or misconfiguring the handshake.

**Next steps:**
1. Double-check that SQL Server is fully started and ready (it can take a minute after container start).
2. Ensure the SQL Server container logs show "SQL Server is now ready for client connections."
3. Try setting `Encrypt=False` and `TrustServerCertificate=True` in your connection string (already set).
4. If using Windows, try using `127.0.0.1` instead of `host.docker.internal` in the connection string for the API container.

Would you like to check the SQL Server container logs or update the connection string to use `127.0.0.1`?

manishgwas: category enpoints were working now they have stopped too

GitHub Copilot: The SQL Server container log shows:  
**"SQL Server is now ready for client connections."**  
and  
**"Recovery is complete. This is an informational message only. No user action is required."**

This means SQL Server is running and accepting connections.

Since both the API and DB are in Docker Compose, the API should use the service name `db` as the SQL Server host, not `host.docker.internal` or `127.0.0.1`.

**Next step:**  
Update your connection string in `docker-compose.yml` for the API to:
```
Server=db,1433;Database=InventoryDb;User Id=sa;Password=Your_password123;TrustServerCertificate=True;Encrypt=False;
```
Would you like me to make this change for you?

manishgwas: host.docker.internal

what does this do

GitHub Copilot: `host.docker.internal` is a special DNS name used in Docker containers to refer to the host machine (your Windows or Mac computer) from inside a container. It allows containers to access services running on the host.

- On Windows and Mac, it resolves to the host's IP address.
- On Linux, it may not work by default.

In your case, since both your API and SQL Server are running as containers in the same Docker Compose network, you should use the service name (`db`) instead of `host.docker.internal` for the SQL Server host in your connection string. This enables direct container-to-container communication.

manishgwas: now test all the endpoints in Categories, Product and Sku
